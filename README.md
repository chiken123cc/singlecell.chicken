Analysis pipelines for the Chicken Single Cell Atlas 

1. Introduction

We present a comprehensive chicken single-cell atlas comprising 1.57 million cells across 36 tissues and 157 cell types. This resource reveals the evolutionary dynamics of avian cell types, particularly immune cells, and provides new insights into immune system evolution across amniotes.

2. Analysis pipeline

This repository contains the analysis pipelines used in the Chicken Single Cell Atlas, including:

CARD for spatial transcriptomics analysis

CCA integration for  data integration

CellChat for cell–cell communication analysis

Gene expression pattern analysis

MAST-based differential expression analysis for single-cell data

MetaNeighbor for cell-type similarity analysis

Monocle and Slingshot for cell developmental trajectory inference

SCENIC/GENIE3 for transcriptional regulatory network analysis

Seurat-based single-cell analysis

Spearman correlation analysis

WGCNA for weighted gene co-expression network analysis
